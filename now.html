        <h2>Learning to ride motorcycles</h2>
        <p>
            I completed my compulsory basic training in August, and bought myself
            a small honda cbf125 motorcycle to learn on. The plan is to do my
            direct access in spring 2025.

            I have had my car license since the age of 17 and never really been 
            interested in riding motorcycles. Suddenly the desire hit me. I 
            love learning things, and so far its been great fun. If your cautious
            and careful, it doesn't have to be as dangerous as its made out ot be.

        <h2>Helping people with cyber security</h2>
        <p>
           My day job is to help people build computer systems that are difficult
           to hack.

        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>
            I'm really into reading books at the moment. I flip flop between
            non-fiction and novels.
